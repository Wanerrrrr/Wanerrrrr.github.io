      <p>Bad Seed is a puzzle game based on a backstory of a serious social issue of juvenile crime. Players experience the story from the perspective of a child who witnesses their grandmother being murdered by another child and embarks on a journey of revenge. As the protagonist progresses, their pursuit of justice gradually transforms into a descent into violence, ultimately becoming a juvenile murderer themselves. This creates a tragic, full-circle narrative arc. My goal is to offer a game that entertains, challenges, and provokes thought—encouraging players to reflect on themes of violence, revenge, innocence, and justice.</p>

    <h2>Art Style & Visual Tone</h2>
    <p>The game adopts a bright, childlike art style, featuring vivid colors, cute character modeling, and stylized shaders such as outlines and halftone effects. This whimsical aesthetic reflects the world as seen through a child’s eyes—playful, innocent, and full of imagination. However, this visual softness stands in stark contrast to the game’s core objective of revenge, creating a powerful sense of irony.</p>

    <h2>Core Design & Gameplay Features</h2>
<div class="details">
    <h3>Possession Mechanic</h3>
    <p>Players can possess specific characters or objects to gain unique abilities. This mechanic is the heart of puzzle-solving and progression. For instance, possessing a cat allows access to high areas, while a torch can burn through obstacles. Players must creatively switch identities to navigate the environment and finally achieve non-violent assassinations.</p>

    <h3>Puzzles and Level Design</h3>
    <p>Targets cannot be eliminated through direct violence. Instead, players must devise clever assassination plans using environmental interactions. The game takes place in a multi-layered urban fantasy environment, combining vertical and horizontal exploration. Features such as surveillance systems, environmental hazards, and AI-driven navigation enrich the stealth and puzzle-solving elements.</p>

    <h3>Balance-based Elevator System</h3>
    <p>Elevators operate based on weight distribution, requiring players to solve spatial puzzles by placing or removing objects to control vertical movement. This system deepens gameplay complexity and ties into level navigation.</p>
